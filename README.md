## Create-X Capstone Project

For my junior design requirement I decided it would be a great opportunity for me to focus on something not so grade oriented, and more entrepreneurial in spirit. I am currently in a Create-X Startup Lab course where I am in a group of other students across a variety of majors (mechanical engineers, engineers, and computer scientists) and am tasked with bringing an idea to life in a one semester period. 

Our initial idea circulated around the growing usage of smart devices in homes across the country. As smart homes have started to increase in frequency around the country, we realized that this would be a great playing ground to come up with ideas to solve problems in the field.

The problem we decided to solve was the issue of home energy maintenence. Nowadays, homes have more electrical devices than ever before and as power bills skyrocket homeowners are left in the dark about what could be causing them such high bills. 

Welcome to TeamIO, our innovative product goes inside of your breaker panel and learns from the usage of devices in your home what device is consuming how much power. It is then able to display this to you in an app (the part of the project I worked on).

Using an Azure backend along with an xCode based front end I was able to design an app to accomplish the task of displaying the data mentioned above to the user!

Note: Still a work in progress, semester is not over yet!
